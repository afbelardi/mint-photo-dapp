# Sample React/Solidity/Hardhat Project

This project, built with Create React App, showcases photos that I took that are part of an NFT collection. The repository includes a smart contract written in Solidity that has functions for minting, setting the baseURI, withdrawing the balance from the contract and more. 

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
```
